#Project Description:
  This is a people tracking project based on face recognition. There will be different cameras in different parts of building. On main entrance, we will take some pictures of people,
  assign them some id, save record in database. Lets say there are some areas in building e.g area A, B, C. At each area there is a camera. After entering, if the person moves 
  to any of these areas, the camera of that particular area recognizes the face, matches with the faces in database and updates the location of person.
